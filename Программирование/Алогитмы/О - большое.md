«Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds but in growth of the number of operations.
Instead of seconds, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
Run time of algorithms is expressed in big O notation.
O(log n) is faster than O(n), and it gets a lot faster as the list of items you’re searching grows.»
